    In another mission, we learned how to simplify an expression with one variable in the
    <a href="http://www.checkio.org/mission/task/share/simplification/729decc8eb4ed99928140d96a8e636b0/">Polynomial</a> mission.
    Now you should try your hand at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_long_division">polynomial
    division</a>.
</p>

<p>
    You are given two polynomials as a list of two strings in following format:
<pre>
    Ð¡N*x*x*...(n times)...*x+CN1*x*x*...(n-1 times)...*x+...+C1*x+C0
    where
    CN, CN1 ...C1, C0 - constants, integers.
    if C = 0, then don't show this term (ex. 2*x*x+3).
    if C = 1, then don't show C. (ex. x*x+2*x), except C0.
    if C = -1, then don't show C, only "-". (ex. x*x-x), except C0.
    </pre>
<p>
    You should try to divide the first polynomial by the second then return the result with its remainder as a list of two strings. 
    A remainder of 0 should be returned as an empty string.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A list of two strings. A dividend, a divisor.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> A list of two strings. A result of division, a remainder.
